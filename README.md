# üß† Object Detection App

A full-stack object detection web app that lets users upload images and returns bounding boxes for detected objects using a pre-trained machine learning model. Built with Flask, Next.js, and good vibes.


## ‚ú® Features

- Upload images through a modern drag-and-drop interface
- Automatically compresses large images client-side
- Sends images to a Flask backend with a Faster R-CNN model
- Displays detected objects with bounding boxes
- Funny fallback messages when nothing is detected
- Responsive dark-mode UI with a clean card layout


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI
- JavaScript (client-side image compression)

**Backend:**

- PyTorch + torchvision (Faster R-CNN)
- CORS enabled API

**Deployment:**
- Frontend: Vercel

## üîß Future Improvements

- Add object filtering or confidence threshold control
- Add model selection (YOLOv8, SSD, etc.)
